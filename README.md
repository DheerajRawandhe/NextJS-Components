# Next.js Components:- Image, Link, and Script
# Introduction
Next.js provides powerful built-in components to enhance performance and user experience. The key components include:

- **`next/image`**: Optimizes images with lazy loading, resizing, and better performance.
- **`next/link`**: Enables client-side navigation for faster page transitions.
- **`next/script`**: Controls how third-party scripts load, improving performance.

# First, run the development server :-
- npm run dev 

 The <Image> component, from next/image, automatically optimizes images by lazy loading and resizing. The <Link> component, from next/link, enables client-side navigation, making page transitions faster. The <Script> component, from next/script, allows controlled loading of third-party scripts, supporting options like lazy loading and priority execution.
